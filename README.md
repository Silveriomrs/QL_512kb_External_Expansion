This is based on the work of McLeod Ideafix, Jose Leandro and tcat between others. 

This board will provide aditional 512Kb of static RAM (fast-ram) to the sinclair QL.

It is incompatible con any aditional expansion on the QL.

Provide a expansion conector to allow conect aditional interfaces.

It's also posible to configure as aditional 256Kb, and use two of this card for a maximun of 899Kb, this is incompatible with a lot of expansion card, so use with caution, there area aditional 192Kb and 128Kb configuration, but is not working yet. 

In the GAL folder there is the source code for winculp
